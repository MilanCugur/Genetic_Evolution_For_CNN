# DoubledMNIST

For purpose of this paper we create fresh dataset for offline handwritten character recognition.

DoubledMNIST dataset should be the successor to the popular MNIST. 
This dataset is duplicated in relation to MNIST and switcihg architecture to DoubledMNIST should be real check of knowledge in machine learning tasks. Link to one-page-paper: [link](https://github.com/MilanCugur/DoubledMNIST/blob/master/paper/DoubledMNIST.pdf).

Dataset dimensions: 140 000 images, resolution 56x56 of each. Read the one page paper for detailed description.

Link to download dataset: [.zip Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LGcnj_bMFqRIwc89D0USb9PANuNdkgAf) (217MB).
